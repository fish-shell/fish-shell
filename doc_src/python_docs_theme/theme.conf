# This theme is based on the python docs theme, version 2020.1.
# Changes:
#
# - References to python changed to fish references (including the logo)
# - Styling was adjusted to fit fishshell.com - a gradient border around the main div, plus a shadow, some other backgrond colors and fonts, a border around the sidebar.
# - The genindex, next/previous and copyright links were removed

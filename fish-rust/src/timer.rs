//! This module houses `TimerSnapshot` which can be used to calculate the elapsed time (system CPU
//! time, user CPU time, and observed wall time, broken down by fish and child processes spawned by
//! fish) between two `TimerSnapshot` instances.
//!
//! Measuring time is always complicated with many caveats. Quite apart from the typical
//! gotchas faced by developers attempting to choose between monotonic vs non-monotonic and system vs
//! cpu clocks, the fact that we are executing as a shell further complicates matters: we can't just
//! observe the elapsed CPU time, because that does not reflect the total execution time for both
//! ourselves (internal shell execution time and the time it takes for builtins and functions to
//! execute) and any external processes we spawn.
//!
//! `std::time::Instant` is used to monitor elapsed wall time. Unlike `SystemTime`, `Instant` is
//! guaranteed to be monotonic though it is likely to not be as high of a precision as we would like
//! but it's still the best we can do because we don't know how long of a time might elapse between
//! `TimerSnapshot` instances and need to avoid rollover.

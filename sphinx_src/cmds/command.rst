command - run a program
==========================================

Synopsis
--------

command [OPTIONS] COMMANDNAME [ARGS...]


\subsection command-description Description

`command` forces the shell to execute the program `COMMANDNAME` and ignore any functions or builtins with the same name.

The following options are available:

- `-a` or `--all` returns all the external commands that are found in `$PATH` in the order they are found.

- `-q` or `--quiet`, in conjunction with `-s`, silences the output and prints nothing, setting only the exit code.

- `-s` or `--search` returns the name of the external command that would be executed, or nothing if no file with the specified name could be found in the `$PATH`.

With the `-s` option, `command` treats every argument as a separate command to look up and sets the exit status to 0 if any of the specified commands were found, or 1 if no commands could be found. Additionally passing a `-q` or `--quiet` option prevents any paths from being printed, like `type -q`, for testing only the exit status.

For basic compatibility with POSIX `command`, the `-v` flag is recognized as an alias for `-s`.

\subsection command-example Examples

`command ls` causes fish to execute the `ls` program, even if an `ls` function exists.

`command -s ls` returns the path to the `ls` program.

`command -sq git; and command git log` runs `git log` only if `git` exists.

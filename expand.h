/**\file expand.h

   Prototypes for string expansion functions. These functions perform
   several kinds of parameter expansion. There are a lot of issues
   with regards to memory allocation. Overall, these functions would
   benefit from using a more clever memory allocation scheme, perhaps
   an evil combination of talloc, string buffers and reference
   counting.

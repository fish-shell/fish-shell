[fish](http://fishshell.com/) - the friendly interactive shell
================================================

fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for OS X, Linux, and the rest of the family. fish includes features like syntax highlighting, autosuggest-as-you-type, and fancy tab completions that just work, with no configuration required.

For more on fish's design philosophy, see the [design document](http://fishshell.com/docs/2.0/design.html).

## Quick Start

fish generally works like other shells, like bash or zsh. A few important differences can be found at <http://fishshell.com/tutorial.html> by searching for magic phrase 'unlike other shells'.

Detailed user documentation is available by running `help` within fish, and also at <http://fishshell.com/docs/2.0/index.html>

## Building

fish is written in a sane subset of C++98, with a few components from C++TR1. It builds successfully with g++ 4.2 or later, and with clang. It also will build as C++11.

fish can be built using autotools or Xcode.

### Autotools Build

    autoconf
    ./configure
    make [gmake on BSD]
    sudo make install

### Xcode Development Build

* Build the `base` target in Xcode
* Run the fish executable, for example, in `DerivedData/fish/Build/Products/Debug/base/bin/fish`

### Xcode Build and Install

    xcodebuild install
    sudo ditto /tmp/fish.dst /

## Help, it didn't build!

If fish reports that it could not find curses, try installing a curses development package and build again.

On Debian or Ubuntu you want:

	sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

on RedHat, CentOS, or Amazon EC2:

    sudo yum install ncurses-devel

## Packages for Linux

Nightly builds for several Linux distros can be downloaded from <http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/siteshwar/>

## Switching to fish

If you wish to use fish as your default shell, use the following command:

	chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish

chsh will prompt you for your password, and change your default shell.

To switch your default shell back, you can run:

	chsh -s /bin/bash

Substitute /bin/bash with /bin/tcsh or /bin/zsh as appropriate.

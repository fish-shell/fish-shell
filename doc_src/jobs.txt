\section jobs jobs - print currently running jobs

\subsection jobs-synopsis Synopsis
<code>jobs [OPTIONS] [PID]</code>

\subsection jobs-description Description
The <code>jobs</code> builtin causes fish to print a list of the currently
running jobs and their status.

jobs accepts the following switches:

- <code>-c</code> or <code>--command</code> print the command name for each process in jobs
- <code>-g</code> or <code>--group</code> only print the group id of each job
- <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> display a help message and exit
- <code>-l</code> or <code>--last</code> only the last job to be started is printed
- <code>-p</code> or <code>--pid</code> print the process id for each process in all jobs

On systems that supports this feature, jobs will print the CPU usage
of each job since the last command was executed. The CPU usage is
expressed as a percentage of full CPU activity. Note that on
multiprocessor systems, the total activity may be more than 100\%.

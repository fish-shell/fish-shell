==========================================

Synopsis
--------

function fish_breakpoint_prompt
    ...
end


\subsection fish_breakpoint_prompt-description Description

By defining the `fish_breakpoint_prompt` function, the user can choose a custom prompt when asking for input in response to a `breakpoint` command. The `fish_breakpoint_prompt` function is executed when the prompt is to be shown, and the output is used as a prompt.

The exit status of commands within `fish_breakpoint_prompt` will not modify the value of <a href="index.html#variables-status">$status</a> outside of the `fish_breakpoint_prompt` function.

`fish` ships with a default version of this function that displays the function name and line number of the current execution context.


\subsection fish_breakpoint_prompt-example Example

A simple prompt that is a simplified version of the default debugging prompt:

\fish
function fish_breakpoint_prompt -d "Write out the debug prompt"
    set -l function (status current-function)
    set -l line (status current-line-number)
    set -l prompt "$function:$line >"
    echo -ns (set_color $fish_color_status) "BP $prompt" (set_color normal) ' '
end
\endfish

\subsection math-description Description

math is used to perform mathematical calcualtions. It is only a very
thin wrapper for the bc program, that makes it possible to specify an
expression from the command line without using non-standard extensions
or a pipeline. Simply use a command like <code>math 1+1</code>. 

For a description of the syntax supported by math, see the manual for
the bc program. Keep in mind that parameter expansion takes place on
any expressions before they are evaluated. This can be very useful in
order to perform calculations involving environment variables or the
output of command substitutions, but it also means that parenthesis
have to be escaped.

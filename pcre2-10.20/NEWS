News about PCRE2 releases
-------------------------

Version 10.20 30-June-2015
--------------------------

1. Callouts with string arguments and the pcre2_callout_enumerate() function
have been implemented.

2. The PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option, which locks out the use of \C, is added.

3. The PCRE2_ALT_CIRCUMFLEX option lets ^ match after a newline at the end of a
subject in multiline mode.

4. The way named subpatterns are handled has been refactored. The previous
approach had several bugs.

5. The handling of \c in EBCDIC environments has been changed to conform to the
perlebcdic document. This is an incompatible change.

6. Bugs have been mended, many of them discovered by fuzzers.


Version 10.10 06-March-2015
---------------------------

1. Serialization and de-serialization functions have been added to the API,
making it possible to save and restore sets of compiled patterns, though
restoration must be done in the same environment that was used for compilation.

2. The (*NO_JIT) feature has been added; this makes it possible for a pattern
creator to specify that JIT is not to be used.

3. A number of bugs have been fixed. In particular, bugs that caused building
on Windows using CMake to fail have been mended.


Version 10.00 05-January-2015
-----------------------------

Version 10.00 is the first release of PCRE2, a revised API for the PCRE
library. Changes prior to 10.00 are logged in the ChangeLog file for the old
API, up to item 20 for release 8.36. New programs are recommended to use the
new library. Programs that use the original (PCRE1) API will need changing
before linking with the new library.

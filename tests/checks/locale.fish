# These tests are needed because the relevant standards allow the functions
# mbrtowc() and wcrtomb() to treat bytes with the high bit set as either valid
# or invalid in the C/POSIX locales. GNU libc treats those bytes as invalid.
# Other libc implementations (e.g., BSD) treat them as valid. We want fish to
# always treat those bytes as valid.

# The fish in the middle of the pipeline should be receiving a UTF-8 encoded
# version of the unicode from the echo. It should pass those bytes thru
# literally since it is in the C locale. We verify this by first passing the
# echo output directly to the `xxd` program then via a fish instance. The
# output should be "58c3bb58" for the first statement and "58c3bc58" for the
# second.

# The next tests deliberately spawn another fish instance to test inheritance of env vars.

# This test is subtle. Despite the presence of the \u00fc unicode char (a "u"
# with an umlaut) the fact the locale is C/POSIX will cause the \xfc byte to
# be emitted rather than the usual UTF-8 sequence \xc3\xbc. That's because the
# few single-byte unicode chars (that are not ASCII) are generally in the
# ISO 8859-x char sets which are encompassed by the C locale. The output should
# be "59fc59".

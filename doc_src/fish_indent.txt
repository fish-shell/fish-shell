\subsection fish_indent-description Description

`fish_indent` is used to indent a piece of fish code. `fish_indent` reads commands from standard input and outputs them to standard output or a specified file.

The following options are available:

- `-d` or `--dump` dumps information about the parsed fish commands to stderr

- `-w` or `--write` indents a specified file and immediately writes to that file

- `-i` or `--no-indent` do not indent commands; only reformat to one job per line

- `-v` or `--version` displays the current fish version and then exits

- `--ansi` colorizes the output using ANSI escape sequences, appropriate for the current $TERM, using the colors defined in the environment (such as `$fish_color_command`).

- `--html` outputs HTML, which supports syntax highlighting if the appropriate CSS is defined. The CSS class names are the same as the variable names, such as `fish_color_command`

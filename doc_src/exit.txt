\section exit exit - exit the shell.

\subsection exit-synopsis Synopsis
<tt>exit [STATUS]</tt>

\subsection exit-description Description

The <tt>exit</tt> builtin causes fish to exit. If <tt>STATUS</tt> is
supplied, it will be converted to an integer and used as the exit
code. Otherwise the exit code will be 0.

If exit is called while sourcing a file (using the <a
href="#source">.</a> builtin) the rest of the file will be skipped,
but the shell itself will not exit.

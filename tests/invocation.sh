# Test that the invocation of the fish executable works as we hope.
#
# We try to run the 'fish' binary with different command line switches.
# Each time we check against an output that we expect.
#
# We are testing fish's invocation itself, so this is not written in
# fish itself - if the invocation wasn't working, we'd never even
# be able to use this test to check that the invocation wasn't working.
#
# What we test...
#
# * The environment is cleaned so that (hopefully) differences in
#   the host terminal, language or user settings do not affect the
#   tests.
#
# * The files 'tests/invocation/*.invoke' contain the arguments that
#   will be passed to the 'fish' command under test. The arguments
#   may be split over multiple lines for clarity.
#
# * Before execution, if the file 'tests/invocation/<name>.config'
#   exists, it will be copied as the 'config.fish' file in the
#   configuration directory.
#
# * The stdout and stderr are captured into files and will be
#   processed before comparison with the
#   'tests/invocation/<name>.(out|err)' files. A missing file is
#   considered to be no output.
#   Either file may be given a further suffix of '.<system name>'
#   which will be used in preference to the default. This allows
#   the expected output to change depending on the system being
#   used - to allow for differences in behaviour.
#   The '<system name>' can be found with 'uname -s'.
#   This facility should be used sparingly as system differences
#   will confuse users.
#
# * The file 'tests/invocation/<name>.grep' is used to select the
#   sections of the file we are interested in within the stdout.
#   Only the parts that match will be compared to the '*.out' file.
#   This can be used to filter out changeable parts of the output
#   leaving just the parts we are interested in.
#
# * The stderr output will have the 'RC: <return code>' appended
#   if the command returned a non-zero value.
#   The stderr output will have the 'XDG_CONFIG_HOME' location
#   substituted, to allow error reports to be compared consistently.
#
# * If the processed output differs from the supplied output,
#   the test will fail, and the differences will be shown on the
#   console.
#
# * If anything fails, the return code for this script will be
#   non-zero.
#

# With this, errors would be fatal.
# However, a return value of non-zero doesn't signal something that necessarily should be fatal.
# For instance, `tput` returns 1 if an attribute isn't defined.
# But we don't want it to kill our script, especially not without any indication.

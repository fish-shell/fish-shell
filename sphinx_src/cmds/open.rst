open - open file in its default application
==========================================

Synopsis
--------

open FILES...


\subsection open-description Description

`open` opens a file in its default application, using the appropriate tool for the operating system. On GNU/Linux, this requires the common but optional `xdg-open` utility, from the `xdg-utils` package.

Note that this function will not be used if a command by this name exists (which is the case on macOS or Haiku).


\subsection open-example Example

`open *.txt` opens all the text files in the current directory using your system's default text editor.

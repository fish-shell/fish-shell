# commands and verifying they are recorded correctly in the interactive
# history and that history can be manipulated is inherently difficult.
#
# This is meant to verify just a few of the most basic behaviors of the
# interactive history to hopefully keep regressions from happening. It is not
# meant to be a comprehensive test of the history subsystem. Those types of
# tests belong in the src/fish_tests.cpp module.

# The history function might pipe output through the user's pager. We don't
# want something like `less` to complicate matters so force the use of `cat`.

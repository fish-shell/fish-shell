\subsection count-description Description

`count` prints the number of arguments that were passed to it. This is usually used to find out how many elements an environment variable array contains.

`count` does not accept any options, including `-h` or `--help`.

`count` exits with a non-zero exit status if no arguments were passed to it, and with zero if at least one argument was passed.

count $PATH
# Returns the number of directories in the users PATH variable.

count *.txt
# Returns the number of files in the current working directory ending with the suffix '.txt'.

# This file adds commands to manage the FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE (hereafter
# FBVF). This file exists in the build directory and is used to populate the
# documentation and also the version string in ghoti_version.o (printed with
# `echo $version` and also ghoti --version). The essential idea is that we are
# going to invoke git_version_gen.sh, which will update the
# FISH-BUILD-VERSION-FILE only if it needs to change; this is what makes
# incremental rebuilds fast.
#
# This code is delicate, with the chief subtlety revolving around Ninja. A
# natural and naive approach would tell the generated build system that FBVF is
# a dependency of ghoti_version.o, and that git_version_gen.sh updates it. Make
# will then invoke the script, check the timestamp on ghoti_version.o and FBVF,
# see that FBVF is earlier, and then not rebuild ghoti_version.o. Ninja,
# however, decides what to build up-front and will unconditionally rebuild
# ghoti_version.o.
#
# To avoid this with Ninja, we want to hook into its 'restat' option which we
# can do through the BYPRODUCTS feature of CMake. See
# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0058.html
#
# Unfortunately BYPRODUCTS behaves strangely with the Makefile generator: it
# marks FBVF as generated and then CMake itself will `touch` it on every build,
# meaning that using BYPRODUCTS will cause ghoti_version.o to be rebuilt
# unconditionally with the Makefile generator. Thus we want to use the
# natural-and-naive approach for Makefiles.

# **IMPORTANT** If you touch these build rules, please test both Ninja and
# Makefile generators with both a clean and dirty git tree. Verify that both
# generated build systems rebuild ghoti when the git tree goes from dirty to
# clean (and vice versa), and verify they do NOT rebuild it when the git tree
# stays the same (incremental builds must be fast).

# Just a handy abbreviation.

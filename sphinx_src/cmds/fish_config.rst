\subsection fish_config-description Description

`fish_config` starts the web-based configuration interface.

The web interface allows you to view your functions, variables and history, and to make changes to your prompt and color configuration.

`fish_config` starts a local web server and then opens a web browser window; when you have finished, close the browser window and then press the Enter key to terminate the configuration session.

`fish_config` optionally accepts name of the initial configuration tab. For e.g. `fish_config history` will start configuration interface with history tab.

If the `BROWSER` environment variable is set, it will be used as the name of the web browser to open instead of the system default.

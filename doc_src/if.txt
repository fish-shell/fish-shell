\subsection if-description Description

`if` will execute the command `CONDITION`. If the condition's exit status is 0, the commands `COMMANDS_TRUE` will execute.  If the exit status is not 0 and `else` is given, `COMMANDS_FALSE` will be executed.

In order to use the exit status of multiple commands as the condition of an if block, use <a href="#begin">`begin; ...; end`</a> and the short circuit commands <a href="commands.html#and">`and`</a> and <a href="commands.html#or">`or`</a>.

The exit status of the last foreground command to exit can always be accessed using the <a href="index.html#variables-status">$status</a> variable.


\subsection if-example Example

The following code will print `foo.txt exists` if the file foo.txt exists and is a regular file, otherwise it will print `bar.txt exists` if the file bar.txt exists and is a regular file, otherwise it will print `foo.txt and bar.txt do not exist`.

\fish
if test -f foo.txt
    echo foo.txt exists
else if test -f bar.txt
    echo bar.txt exists
else
    echo foo.txt and bar.txt do not exist
end
\endfish

The following code will print "foo.txt exists and is readable" if foo.txt is a regular file and readable
\fish
if begin test -f foo.txt
   		 and test -r foo.txt
		 end
   echo "foo.txt exists and is readable"
end
\endfish

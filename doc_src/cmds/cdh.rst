.. _cmd-cdh:

cdh - change to a recently visited directory
============================================

Synopsis
--------

::

    cdh [ directory ]


Description
-----------

``cdh`` with no arguments presents a list of recently visited directories. You can then select one of the entries by letter or number. You can also press :kbd:`Tab` to use the completion pager to select an item from the list. If you give it a single argument it is equivalent to ``cd directory``.

Note that the ``cd`` command limits directory history to the 25 most recently visited directories. The history is stored in the ``$dirprev`` and ``$dirnext`` variables which this command manipulates. If you make those universal variables your ``cd`` history is shared among all fish instances.

--------

See also the :ref:`prevd <cmd-prevd>` and :ref:`pushd <cmd-pushd>` commands which also work with the recent ``cd`` history and are provided for compatibility with other shells.

\subsection alias-description Description

`alias` is a simple wrapper for the `function` builtin. It exists for backwards compatibility with Posix shells. For other uses, it is recommended to define a <a href='#function'>function</a>.

`fish` does not keep track of which functions have been defined using `alias`. They must be erased using `functions -e`.

- `NAME` is the name of the alias

- `DEFINITION` is the actual command to execute. The string `$argv` will be appended.

You cannot create an alias to a function with the same name.


\subsection alias-example Example

The following code will create `rmi`, which runs `rm` with additional arguments on every invocation.

\fish
alias rmi "rm -i"

# This is equivalent to entering the following function:

function rmi
    rm -i $argv
end
\endfish

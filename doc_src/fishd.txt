\subsection fishd-description Description

The \c fishd daemon is used to load, save and distribute universal
variable information. fish automatically connects to fishd via a socket
on startup. If no instance of fishd is running, fish spawns a new
fishd instance. fishd will create a socket in /tmp, and wait for
incoming connections from universal variable clients, such as fish,
When no clients are connected, fishd will automatically shut down.

\subsection fishd-files Files

\c ~/.config/fish/fishd.MACHINE_ID permanent storage location for universal
variable data. MACHINE_ID is generally based on the machine's MAC address.
The data is stored as a set of \c set and \c set_export commands such as
would be parsed by fishd. The file must always be stored in ASCII format.
If an instance of fishd is running (which is generally the case), manual
modifications to ~/.fishd.MACHINE_ID will be lost. Do NOT edit this file manually!

\c /tmp/fishd.socket.USERNAME the socket which fishd uses to communicate
with all clients.

/tmp/fishd.log.USERNAME the fishd log file

<!--
Please tell us which fish version you are using by executing the following:

  fish --version
  echo $version

Please tell us which operating system (output of `uname`) and terminal you are using.

Please tell us if you tried fish without third-party customizations by executing this command and whether it affected the behavior you are reporting:

  sh -c 'env HOME=$(mktemp -d) XDG_CONFIG_HOME= XDG_DATA_DIRS= fish'

Tell us how to reproduce the problem. Including an asciinema.org recording is useful for problems that involve the visual display of fish output such as its prompt.

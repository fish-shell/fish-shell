\section source source - evaluate contents of file.

\subsection source-synopsis Synopsis
<tt>source FILENAME [ARGUMENTS...]</tt>

\subsection source-description Description

\c source evaluates the commands of the specified file in the current
shell. This is different from starting a new process to perform the
commands (i.e. <tt>fish < FILENAME</tt>) since the commands will be
evaluated by the current shell, which means that changes in
environment variables affect the current shell. If additional arguments are
specified after the file name, they will be inserted into the $argv
variable.

If no file is specified, or if the file name '-' is used, stdin will
be read.

The return status of \c source is the return status of the last job to
execute. If something goes wrong while opening or reading the file,
\c source exits with a non-zero status.

\subsection source-example Example

<tt>source ~/.config/fish/config.fish</tt> causes fish to re-read its initialization file.

disown - remove a process from the list of jobs
==========================================

Synopsis
--------

disown [ PID ... ]


Description
------------

`disown` removes the specified <a href="index.html#syntax-job-control">job</a> from the list of jobs. The job itself continues to exist, but fish does not keep track of it any longer.

Jobs in the list of jobs are sent a hang-up signal when fish terminates, which usually causes the job to terminate; `disown` allows these processes to continue regardless.

If no process is specified, the most recently-used job is removed (like `bg` and `fg`).  If one or more `PID`s are specified, jobs with the specified process IDs are removed from the job list. Invalid jobs are ignored and a warning is printed.

If a job is stopped, it is sent a signal to continue running, and a warning is printed. It is not possible to use the `bg` builtin to continue a job once it has been disowned.

`disown` returns 0 if all specified jobs were disowned successfully, and 1 if any problems were encountered.

Example
------------

`firefox &; disown` will start the Firefox web browser in the background and remove it from the job list, meaning it will not be closed when the fish process is closed.

`disown (jobs -p)` removes all jobs from the job list without terminating them.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.nf
.B int pcre2_substring_copy_byname(pcre2_match_data *\fImatch_data\fP,
.B "  PCRE2_SPTR \fIname\fP, PCRE2_UCHAR *\fIbuffer\fP, PCRE2_SIZE *\fIbufflen\fP);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This is a convenience function for extracting a captured substring, identified
by name, into a given buffer. The arguments are:
.sp
  \fImatch_data\fP    The match data block for the match
  \fIname\fP          Name of the required substring
  \fIbuffer\fP        Buffer to receive the string
  \fIbufflen\fP       Length of buffer (code units)
.sp
The \fIbufflen\fP variable is updated to contain the length of the extracted
string, excluding the trailing zero. The yield of the function is zero for
success or one of the following error numbers:
.sp
  PCRE2_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING   there are no groups of that name
  PCRE2_ERROR_UNAVAILBLE    the ovector was too small for that group
  PCRE2_ERROR_UNSET         the group did not participate in the match
  PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY      the buffer is not big enough
.sp
If there is more than one group with the given name, the first one that is set
is returned. In this situation PCRE2_ERROR_UNSET means that no group with the
given name was set.

\section source . - evaluate contents of file.

\subsection source-synopsis Synopsis
<tt>. FILENAME [ARGUMENTS...]</tt>

\subsection source-description Description 

Evaluates the commands of the specified file in the current
shell. This is different from starting a new process to perform the
commands (i.e. <tt>fish < FILENAME</tt>) since the commands will be
evaluated by the current shell, which means that changes in
environment variables, etc., will remain. If additional arguments are
specified after the file name, they will be inserted into the $argv
variable.

If no file is specified, or if the file name '-' is used, stdin will
be read.

The return status of . is the return status of the last job to
execute. If something goes wrong while opening or reading the file,
. exits with a non-zero status.

\subsection source-example Example

<tt>. ~/.fish</tt>

causes fish to reread its initialization file.

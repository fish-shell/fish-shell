\subsection test-example Example

<tt>
    if test -d "/"                                                                                                                                                    
	echo "Fish is cool";                                                                                                                                      
    end  
</tt> 

Because "/" is a directory the expression will evaluate
to true, and "Fish is cool" will be echoed

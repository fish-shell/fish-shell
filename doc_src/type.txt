\subsection type-synopsis Synopsis
 <tt>type [OPTIONS] NAME [NAME ...]</tt>

\subsection type-description Description

With no options, \c type indicates how each \c NAME would be interpreted if used as a command name.

The following options are available:

- \c -h or \c --help prints help and then exits.
- \c -a or \c --all prints all of possible definitions of the specified names.
- \c -f or \c --no-functions suppresses function and builtin lookup.
- \c -t or \c --type prints <tt>function</tt>, <tt>builtin</tt>, or <tt>file</tt> if \c NAME is a shell function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.
- \c -p or \c --path returns the name of the disk file that would be executed, or nothing if 'type  -t  name' would not return 'file'.
- \c -P or \c --force-path returns the name of the disk file that would be executed, or nothing if no file with the specified name could be found in the <tt>$PATH</tt>.
- \c -q or \c --quiet suppresses all output; this is useful when testing the exit status.

\c type sets the exit status to 0 if the specified command was found,
and 1 if it could not be found.

\subsection type-example Example

<tt>type fg</tt> outputs the string 'fg is a shell builtin'.

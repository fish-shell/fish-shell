    # Make ls use colors and show indicators if we are on a system that supports that feature and writing to stdout.

    # BSD, macOS and others support colors with ls -G.
    # GNU ls and FreeBSD ls takes --color=auto. Order of this test is important because ls also takes -G but it has a different meaning.
    # Solaris 11's ls command takes a --color flag.
    # OpenBSD requires the separate colorls program for color support.
    # Also test -F because we'll want to define this function even with an ls that can't do colors (like NetBSD).

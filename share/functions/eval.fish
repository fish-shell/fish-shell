    # To eval 'foo', we construct a block "begin ; foo; end <&3 3<&-"
    # Note the redirections are also within the quotes.
    #
    # We then pipe this to 'source 3<&0’.
    #
    # You might expect that the dup2(3, stdin) should overwrite stdin,
    # and therefore prevent 'source' from reading the piped-in block. This doesn't happen
    # because when you pipe to a builtin, we don't overwrite stdin with the read end
    # of the block; instead we set a separate fd in a variable 'builtin_stdin', which is
    # what it reads from. So builtins are magic in that, in pipes, their stdin
    # is not fd 0.
    #
    # ‘source’ does not apply the redirections to itself. Instead it saves them and passes
    # them as block-level redirections to parser.eval(). Ultimately the eval’d code sees
    # the following redirections (in the following order):
    #    dup2 0 -> 3
    #    dup2 pipe -> 0
    #    dup2 3 -> 0
    # where the pipe is the pipe we get from piping ‘echo’ to ‘source’. Thus the redirection
    # effectively makes stdin fd0, instead of the thing that was piped to ‘source’

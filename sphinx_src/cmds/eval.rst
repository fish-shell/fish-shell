eval - evaluate the specified commands
==========================================

Synopsis
--------

eval [COMMANDS...]


Description
------------
`eval` evaluates the specified parameters as a command. If more than one parameter is specified, all parameters will be joined using a space character as a separator.

If your command does not need access to stdin, consider using `source` instead.

Example
------------

The following code will call the ls command. Note that `fish` does not support the use of shell variables as direct commands; `eval` can be used to work around this.

\fish
set cmd ls
eval $cmd
\endfish

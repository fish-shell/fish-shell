suspend - suspend the current shell
==========================================

Synopsis
--------

suspend [--force]


Description
------------

``suspend`` suspends execution of the current shell by sending it a
SIGTSTP signal, returning to the controlling process. It can be
resumed later by sending it a SIGCONT.  In order to prevent suspending
a shell that doesn't have a controlling process, it will not suspend
the shell if it is a login shell. This requirement is bypassed
if the ``--force`` option is given or the shell is not interactive.

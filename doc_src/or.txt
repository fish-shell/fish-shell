\subsection or-description Description

`or` is used to execute a command if the current exit status (as set by the last previous command) is not 0.

`or` does not change the current exit status.

The exit status of the last foreground command to exit can always be accessed using the <a href="index.html#variables-status">$status</a> variable.


\subsection or-example Example

The following code runs the `make` command to build a program. If the build succeeds, the program is installed. If either step fails, `make clean` is run, which removes the files created by the build process.

\fish
make; and make install; or make clean
\endfish

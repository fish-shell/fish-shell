\subsection eval-description Description
`eval` evaluates the specified parameters as a command. If more than one parameter is specified, all parameters will be joined using a space character as a separator.


\subsection eval-example Example

The following code will call the ls command. Note that `fish` does not support the use of shell variables as direct commands; `eval` can be used to work around this.

\fish
set cmd ls
eval $cmd
\endfish

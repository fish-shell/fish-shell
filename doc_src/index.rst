Introduction
************

This is the documentation for **fish**, the **f**\ riendly **i**\ nteractive **sh**\ ell.

A shell is a program that helps you operate your computer by starting other programs. fish offers a command-line interface focused on usability and interactive use.

Unlike other shells, fish does not follow the POSIX standard, but still uses roughly the same model.

Some of the special features of fish are:

- **Extensive UI**: :ref:`Syntax highlighting <color>`, :ref:`autosuggestions`, :ref:`tab completion <tab-completion>` and selection lists that can be navigated and filtered.

- **No configuration needed**: fish is designed to be ready to use immediately, without requiring extensive configuration.

- **Easy scripting**: New :ref:`functions <syntax-function>` can be added on the fly. The syntax is easy to learn and use.

This page explains how to install and set up fish and where to get more information.

If this is your first time using fish, see the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`.

If you are already familiar with other shells like bash and want to see the scripting differences, see :ref:`Fish For Bash Users <fish_for_bash_users>`.

For a comprehensive overview of fish's scripting language, see :ref:`The Fish Language <language>`.

For information on using fish interactively, see :ref:`Interactive use <interactive>`.

Installation and Start
======================

This section describes how to install, uninstall, start, and exit the fish shell. It also explains how to make fish the default shell.

Installation
------------

Up-to-date instructions for installing the latest version of fish are on the `fish homepage <https://fishshell.com/>`_.

To install the development version of fish, see the instructions on the `project's GitHub page <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell>`_.

Starting and Exiting
--------------------

Once fish has been installed, open a terminal. If fish is not the default shell:

- Type ``fish`` to start a fish shell::

    > fish

- Type ``exit`` to exit a fish shell::

    > exit

Executing Bash
--------------

If fish is your default shell and you want to copy commands from the internet that are written in bash (the default shell on most systems), you can proceed in one of the following two ways:

- Use the ``bash`` command with the ``-c`` switch to read from a string::

    > bash -c 'some bash command'

- Use ``bash`` without a switch to open a bash shell you can use and ``exit`` afterward::

    > bash
    $ some bash command
    $ exit
    > _

Default Shell
-------------

To make fish your default shell:

- Add the line ``/usr/local/bin/fish`` to ``/etc/shells``.
- Change your default shell with ``chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish``.

For detailed instructions see :ref:`Switching to fish <switching-to-fish>`.

Uninstalling
------------

For uninstalling fish: see :ref:`FAQ: Uninstalling fish <faq-uninstalling>`.

Shebang Line
------------

Because shell scripts are written in many different languages, they need to carry information about which interpreter should be used to execute them. For this, they are expected to have a first line, the shebang line, which names the interpreter executable.

A script written in ``bash`` would need a first line like this::

    #!/bin/bash

When the shell tells the kernel to execute the file, it will use the interpreter ``/bin/bash``.

For a script written in another language, just replace ``/bin/bash`` with the interpreter for that language (for example: ``/usr/bin/python`` for a python script, or ``/usr/local/bin/fish`` for a fish script).

This line is only needed when scripts are executed without specifying the interpreter. For functions inside fish or when executing a script with ``fish /path/to/script``, a shebang is not required (but it doesn't hurt!).

.. _initialization:

Initialization files
====================

On startup, Fish evaluates a number of configuration files, which can be used to control the behavior of the shell. The location of these is controlled by a number of environment variables, and their default or usual location is given below.

Configuration files are evaluated in the following order:

- Configuration shipped with fish, which should not be edited, in ``$__fish_data_dir/config.fish`` (usually ``/usr/share/fish/config.fish``).

- Configuration snippets in files ending in ``.fish``, in the directories:

  - ``$__fish_config_dir/conf.d`` (by default, ``~/.config/fish/conf.d/``)
  - ``$__fish_sysconf_dir/conf.d`` (by default, ``/etc/fish/conf.d/``)
  - Directories for third-party software vendors to ship their own configuration snippets for their software. Fish searches the directories in the ``XDG_DATA_DIRS`` environment variable for a ``fish/vendor_conf.d`` directory; if this variable is not defined, the default is usually to search ``/usr/share/fish/vendor_conf.d`` and ``/usr/local/share/fish/vendor_conf.d``

  If there are multiple files with the same name in these directories, only the first will be executed.
  They are executed in order of their filename, sorted (like globs) in a natural order (i.e. "01" sorts before "2").

- System-wide configuration files, where administrators can include initialization that should be run for all users on the system - similar to ``/etc/profile`` for POSIX-style shells - in ``$__fish_sysconf_dir`` (usually ``/etc/fish/config.fish``).
- User initialization, usually in ``~/.config/fish/config.fish`` (controlled by the ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` environment variable, and accessible as ``$__fish_config_dir``).

These paths are controlled by parameters set at build, install, or run time, and may vary from the defaults listed above.

This wide search may be confusing. If you are unsure where to put your own customisations, use ``~/.config/fish/config.fish``.

Note that ``~/.config/fish/config.fish`` is sourced `after` the snippets. This is so users can copy snippets and override some of their behavior.

These files are all executed on the startup of every shell. If you want to run a command only on starting an interactive shell, use the exit status of the command ``status --is-interactive`` to determine if the shell is interactive. If you want to run a command only when using a login shell, use ``status --is-login`` instead. This will speed up the starting of non-interactive or non-login shells.

If you are developing another program, you may wish to install configuration which is run for all users of the fish shell on a system. This is discouraged; if not carefully written, they may have side-effects or slow the startup of the shell. Additionally, users of other shells will not benefit from the Fish-specific configuration. However, if they are absolutely required, you may install them to the "vendor" configuration directory. As this path may vary from system to system, the ``pkgconfig`` framework should be used to discover this path with the output of ``pkg-config --variable confdir fish``.

Examples:

If you want to add the directory ``~/linux/bin`` to your PATH variable when using a login shell, add the following to your ``~/.config/fish/config.fish`` file::

    if status --is-login
        set -gx PATH $PATH ~/linux/bin
    end

If you want to run a set of commands when fish exits, use an :ref:`event handler <event>` that is triggered by the exit of the shell::


    function on_exit --on-event fish_exit
        echo fish is now exiting
    end

.. _featureflags:

Future feature flags
====================

Feature flags are how fish stages changes that might break scripts. Breaking changes are introduced as opt-in, in a few releases they become opt-out, and eventually the old behavior is removed.

You can see the current list of features via ``status features``::

    > status features
    stderr-nocaret  on     3.0      ^ no longer redirects stderr
    qmark-noglob    off    3.0      ? no longer globs
    regex-easyesc   off    3.1      string replace -r needs fewer \\'s

There are two breaking changes in fish 3.0: caret ``^`` no longer redirects stderr, and question mark ``?`` is no longer a glob.

There is one breaking change in fish 3.1: ``string replace -r`` does a superfluous round of escaping for the replacement, so escaping backslashes would look like ``string replace -ra '([ab])' '\\\\\\\$1' a``. This flag removes that if turned on, so ``'\\\\$1'`` is enough.


These changes are off by default. They can be enabled on a per session basis::

    > fish --features qmark-noglob,stderr-nocaret


or opted into globally for a user::


    > set -U fish_features stderr-nocaret qmark-noglob

Features will only be set on startup, so this variable will only take effect if it is universal or exported.

You can also use the version as a group, so ``3.0`` is equivalent to "stderr-nocaret" and "qmark-noglob".

Prefixing a feature with ``no-`` turns it off instead.

.. _event:

Event handlers
==============

When defining a new function in fish, it is possible to make it into an event handler, i.e. a function that is automatically run when a specific event takes place. Events that can trigger a handler currently are:

- When a signal is delivered
- When a job exits
- When the value of a variable is updated
- When the prompt is about to be shown

Example:

To specify a signal handler for the WINCH signal, write::

    function my_signal_handler --on-signal WINCH
        echo Got WINCH signal!
    end

Please note that event handlers only become active when a function is loaded, which means you might need to otherwise :ref:`source <cmd-source>` or execute a function instead of relying on :ref:`autoloading <syntax-function-autoloading>`. One approach is to put it into your :ref:`initialization file <initialization>`.

For more information on how to define new event handlers, see the documentation for the :ref:`function <cmd-function>` command.


.. _debugging:

Debugging fish scripts
======================

Fish includes a built in debugging facility. The debugger allows you to stop execution of a script at an arbitrary point. When this happens you are presented with an interactive prompt. At this prompt you can execute any fish command (there are no debug commands as such). For example, you can check or change the value of any variables using :ref:`printf <cmd-printf>` and :ref:`set <cmd-set>`. As another example, you can run :ref:`status print-stack-trace <cmd-status>` to see how this breakpoint was reached. To resume normal execution of the script, simply type :ref:`exit <cmd-exit>` or :kbd:`Control`\ +\ :kbd:`D`.

To start a debug session simply run the builtin command :ref:`breakpoint <cmd-breakpoint>` at the point in a function or script where you wish to gain control. Also, the default action of the TRAP signal is to call this builtin. So a running script can be debugged by sending it the TRAP signal with the ``kill`` command. Once in the debugger, it is easy to insert new breakpoints by using the funced function to edit the definition of a function.

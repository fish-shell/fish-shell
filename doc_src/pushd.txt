\subsection pushd-description Description

The `pushd` function adds `DIRECTORY` to the top of the directory stack and makes it the current working directory. <a href="#popd">`popd`</a> will pop it off and return to the original directory.

Without arguments, it exchanges the top two directories in the stack.

`pushd +NUMBER` rotates the stack counter-clockwise i.e. from bottom to top

`pushd -NUMBER` rotates clockwise i.e. top to bottom.

See also `dirs` and `dirs -c`.

/**
  A structure representing a single fish process. Contains variables
  for tracking process state and the process argument
  list. Actually, a fish process can be either a regular external
  process, an internal builtin which may or may not spawn a fake IO
  process during execution, a shellscript function or a block of
  commands to be evaluated by calling eval. Lastly, this process can
  be the result of an exec command. The role of this process_t is
  determined by the type field, which can be one of EXTERNAL,
  INTERNAL_BUILTIN, INTERNAL_FUNCTION, INTERNAL_EXEC.

  The process_t contains information on how the process should be
  started, such as command name and arguments, as well as runtime
  information on the status of the actual physical process which
  represents it. Shellscript functions, builtins and blocks of code
  may all need to spawn an external process that handles the piping
  and redirecting of IO for them.

  If the process is of type EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_EXEC, argv is the
  argument array and actual_cmd is the absolute path of the command
  to execute.

  If the process is of type INTERNAL_BUILTIN, argv is the argument
  vector, and argv[0] is the name of the builtin command.

  If the process is of type INTERNAL_FUNCTION, argv is the argument
  vector, and argv[0] is the name of the shellscript function.

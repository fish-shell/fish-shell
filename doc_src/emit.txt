\subsection emit-description Description

The emit builtin fires a generic fish event. Such events can be caught by special functions called event handlers.

\subsection emit-example Example

The following code first defines an event handler for the generic
event named 'test_event', and then emits an event of that type.

<pre>function event_test --on-event test_event
    echo event test!!!
end

emit test_event</pre>

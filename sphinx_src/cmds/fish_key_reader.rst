fish_key_reader [OPTIONS]


\subsection fish_key_reader-description Description

`fish_key_reader` is used to study input received from the terminal and can help with key binds. The program is interactive and works on standard input. Individual characters themselves and their hexadecimal values are displayed.

The tool will write an example `bind` command matching the character sequence captured to stdout. If the character sequence matches a special key name (see `bind --key-names`),  both `bind CHARS ...` and `bind -k KEYNAME ...` usage will be shown. Additional details about the characters received, such as the delay between chars, are written to stderr.

The following options are available:

- `-c` or `--continuous` begins a session where multiple key sequences can be inspected. By default the program exits after capturing a single key sequence.

- `-d` or `--debug-level=DEBUG_LEVEL` enables debug output and specifies a verbosity level (like `fish -d`). Defaults to 0.

- `-D` or `--debug-stack-frames=DEBUG_LEVEL` specify how many stack frames to display when debug messages are written. The default is zero. A value of 3 or 4 is usually sufficient to gain insight into how a given debug call was reached but you can specify a value up to 128.

- `-h` or `--help` prints usage information.

- `-v` or `--version` prints fish_key_reader's version and exits.

\subsection fish_key_reader-usage-notes Usage Notes

The delay in milliseconds since the previous character was received is included in the diagnostic information written to stderr. This information may be useful to determine the optimal `fish_escape_delay_ms` setting or learn the amount of lag introduced by tools like `ssh`, `mosh` or `tmux`.

`fish_key_reader` intentionally disables handling of many signals. To terminate `fish_key_reader` in `--continuous` mode do:

- press `Ctrl-C` twice, or
- press `Ctrl-D` twice, or
- type `exit`, or
- type `quit`

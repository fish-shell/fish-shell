\subsection abbr-description Description

`abbr` manipulates the list of abbreviations that fish will expand.

Abbreviations are user-defined character sequences or words that are replaced with longer phrases after they are entered. For example, a frequently-run command such as `git checkout` can be abbreviated to `gco`. After entering `gco` and pressing @key{Space} or @key{Enter}, the full text `git checkout` will appear in the command line.

Abbreviations are stored, by default, in a universal variable.

The following parameters are available:

- `-a 'WORD=PHRASE'` or `--add 'WORD=PHRASE'` Adds a new abbreviation, where WORD will be expanded to PHRASE. Only a single argument is supported - protect the contents with quotes or escapes.

- `-s` or `--show` Show all abbreviated words and their expanded phrases in a manner suitable for export and import.

- `-l` or `--list` Lists all abbreviated words.

- `-r WORD` or `--remove WORD` Remove the abbreviation WORD.

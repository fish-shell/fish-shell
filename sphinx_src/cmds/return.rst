return - stop the current inner function
==========================================

Synopsis
--------

function NAME; [COMMANDS...;] return [STATUS]; [COMMANDS...;] end


Description
------------

``return`` halts a currently running function. The exit status is set to ``STATUS`` if it is given.

It is usually added inside of a conditional block such as an <a href="#if">if</a> statement or a <a href="#switch">switch</a> statement to conditionally stop the executing function and return to the caller, but it can also be used to specify the exit status of a function.


Example
------------

The following code is an implementation of the false command as a fish function



::

    function false
        return 1
    end

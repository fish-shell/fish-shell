\subsection dirh-description Description

`dirh` prints the current directory history. The current position in the history is highlighted using the color defined in the `fish_color_history_current` environment variable.

`dirh` does not accept any parameters.

Note that the `cd` command limits directory history to the 25 most recently visited directories. The history is stored in the `$dirprev` and `$dirnext` variables.

.. _cmd-break:

break - stop the current inner loop
===================================

Synopsis
--------

::

    LOOP_CONSTRUCT; [COMMANDS...] break; [COMMANDS...] end


Description
-----------

``break`` halts a currently running loop, such as a :ref:`switch <cmd-switch>`, :ref:`for <cmd-for>` or :ref:`while <cmd-while>` loop. It is usually added inside of a conditional block such as an :ref:`if <cmd-if>` block.

There are no parameters for ``break``.


Example
-------
The following code searches all .c files for "smurf", and halts at the first occurrence.

::

    for i in *.c
        if grep smurf $i
            echo Smurfs are present in $i
            break
        end
    end

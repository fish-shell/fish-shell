\subsection help-description Description

`help` displays the fish help documentation.

If a `SECTION` is specified, the help for that command is shown.

If the BROWSER environment variable is set, it will be used to display the documentation. Otherwise, fish will search for a suitable browser.

Note that most builtin commands display their help in the terminal when given the `--help` option.


\subsection help-example Example

`help fg` shows the documentation for the `fg` builtin.

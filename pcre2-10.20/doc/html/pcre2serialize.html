If you are running an application that uses a large number of regular
expression patterns, it may be useful to store them in a precompiled form
instead of having to compile them every time the application is run. However,
if you are using the just-in-time optimization feature, it is not possible to
save and reload the JIT data, because it is position-dependent. In addition,
the host on which the patterns are reloaded must be running the same version of
PCRE2, with the same code unit width, and must also have the same endianness,
pointer width and PCRE2_SIZE type. For example, patterns compiled on a 32-bit
system using PCRE2's 16-bit library cannot be reloaded on a 64-bit system, nor
can they be reloaded using the 8-bit library.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC2" href="#TOC1">SAVING COMPILED PATTERNS</a><br>
<P>
Before compiled patterns can be saved they must be serialized, that is,
converted to a stream of bytes. A single byte stream may contain any number of
compiled patterns, but they must all use the same character tables. A single
copy of the tables is included in the byte stream (its size is 1088 bytes). For
more details of character tables, see the
<a href="pcre2api.html#localesupport">section on locale support</a>
in the
<a href="pcre2api.html"><b>pcre2api</b></a>
documentation.
</P>
<P>
The function <b>pcre2_serialize_encode()</b> creates a serialized byte stream
from a list of compiled patterns. Its first two arguments specify the list,
being a pointer to a vector of pointers to compiled patterns, and the length of
the vector. The third and fourth arguments point to variables which are set to
point to the created byte stream and its length, respectively. The final
argument is a pointer to a general context, which can be used to specify custom
memory mangagement functions. If this argument is NULL, <b>malloc()</b> is used
to obtain memory for the byte stream. The yield of the function is the number
of serialized patterns, or one of the following negative error codes:
<pre>
  PCRE2_ERROR_BADDATA      the number of patterns is zero or less
  PCRE2_ERROR_BADMAGIC     mismatch of id bytes in one of the patterns
  PCRE2_ERROR_MEMORY       memory allocation failed
  PCRE2_ERROR_MIXEDTABLES  the patterns do not all use the same tables
  PCRE2_ERROR_NULL         the 1st, 3rd, or 4th argument is NULL
</pre>
PCRE2_ERROR_BADMAGIC means either that a pattern's code has been corrupted, or
that a slot in the vector does not point to a compiled pattern.
</P>
<P>
Once a set of patterns has been serialized you can save the data in any
appropriate manner. Here is sample code that compiles two patterns and writes
them to a file. It assumes that the variable <i>fd</i> refers to a file that is
open for output. The error checking that should be present in a real
application has been omitted for simplicity.
<pre>
  int errorcode;
  uint8_t *bytes;
  PCRE2_SIZE erroroffset;
  PCRE2_SIZE bytescount;
  pcre2_code *list_of_codes[2];
  list_of_codes[0] = pcre2_compile("first pattern",
    PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED, 0, &errorcode, &erroroffset, NULL);
  list_of_codes[1] = pcre2_compile("second pattern",
    PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED, 0, &errorcode, &erroroffset, NULL);
  errorcode = pcre2_serialize_encode(list_of_codes, 2, &bytes,
    &bytescount, NULL);
  errorcode = fwrite(bytes, 1, bytescount, fd);
</pre>
Note that the serialized data is binary data that may contain any of the 256
possible byte values. On systems that make a distinction between binary and
non-binary data, be sure that the file is opened for binary output.
</P>
<P>
Serializing a set of patterns leaves the original data untouched, so they can
still be used for matching. Their memory must eventually be freed in the usual
way by calling <b>pcre2_code_free()</b>. When you have finished with the byte
stream, it too must be freed by calling <b>pcre2_serialize_free()</b>.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC3" href="#TOC1">RE-USING PRECOMPILED PATTERNS</a><br>
<P>
In order to re-use a set of saved patterns you must first make the serialized
byte stream available in main memory (for example, by reading from a file). The
management of this memory block is up to the application. You can use the
<b>pcre2_serialize_get_number_of_codes()</b> function to find out how many
compiled patterns are in the serialized data without actually decoding the
patterns:
<pre>
  uint8_t *bytes = &#60;serialized data&#62;;
  int32_t number_of_codes = pcre2_serialize_get_number_of_codes(bytes);
</pre>
The <b>pcre2_serialize_decode()</b> function reads a byte stream and recreates
the compiled patterns in new memory blocks, setting pointers to them in a
vector. The first two arguments are a pointer to a suitable vector and its
length, and the third argument points to a byte stream. The final argument is a
pointer to a general context, which can be used to specify custom memory
mangagement functions for the decoded patterns. If this argument is NULL,
<b>malloc()</b> and <b>free()</b> are used. After deserialization, the byte
stream is no longer needed and can be discarded.
<pre>
  int32_t number_of_codes;
  pcre2_code *list_of_codes[2];
  uint8_t *bytes = &#60;serialized data&#62;;
  int32_t number_of_codes =
    pcre2_serialize_decode(list_of_codes, 2, bytes, NULL);
</pre>
If the vector is not large enough for all the patterns in the byte stream, it
is filled with those that fit, and the remainder are ignored. The yield of the
function is the number of decoded patterns, or one of the following negative
error codes:
<pre>
  PCRE2_ERROR_BADDATA   second argument is zero or less
  PCRE2_ERROR_BADMAGIC  mismatch of id bytes in the data
  PCRE2_ERROR_BADMODE   mismatch of variable unit size or PCRE2 version
  PCRE2_ERROR_MEMORY    memory allocation failed
  PCRE2_ERROR_NULL      first or third argument is NULL
</pre>
PCRE2_ERROR_BADMAGIC may mean that the data is corrupt, or that it was compiled
on a system with different endianness.
</P>
<P>
Decoded patterns can be used for matching in the usual way, and must be freed
by calling <b>pcre2_code_free()</b> as normal. A single copy of the character
tables is used by all the decoded patterns. A reference count is used to
arrange for its memory to be automatically freed when the last pattern is
freed.
</P>
<P>
If a pattern was processed by <b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b> before being
serialized, the JIT data is discarded and so is no longer available after a
save/restore cycle. You can, however, process a restored pattern with
<b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b> if you wish.

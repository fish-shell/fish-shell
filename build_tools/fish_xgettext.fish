        # Using xgettext causes more trouble than it helps.
        # This is due to handling of escaping in fish differing from formats xgettext understands
        # (e.g. POSIX shell strings).
        # We work around this issue by manually writing the file content.

        # Steps:
        # 1. We extract strings to be translated from the relevant files and drop the rest. This step
        #    depends on the regex matching the entire line, and the first capture group matching the
        #    string.
        # 2. We unescape. This gets rid of some escaping necessary in fish strings.
        # 3. The resulting strings are sorted alphabetically. This step is optional. Not sorting would
        #    result in strings from the same file appearing together. Removing duplicates is also
        #    optional, since msguniq takes care of that later on as well.
        # 4. Single backslashes are replaced by double backslashes. This results in the backslashes
        #    being interpreted as literal backslashes by gettext tooling.
        # 5. Double quotes are escaped, such that they are not interpreted as the start or end of
        #    a msgid.
        # 6. We transform the string into the format expected in a PO file.

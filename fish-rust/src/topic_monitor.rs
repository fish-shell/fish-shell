/*! Topic monitoring support.

Topics are conceptually "a thing that can happen." For example,
delivery of a SIGINT, a child process exits, etc. It is possible to post to a topic, which means
that that thing happened.

Associated with each topic is a current generation, which is a 64 bit value. When you query a
topic, you get back a generation. If on the next query the generation has increased, then it
indicates someone posted to the topic.

For example, if you are monitoring a child process, you can query the sigchld topic. If it has
increased since your last query, it is possible that your child process has exited.

Topic postings may be coalesced. That is there may be two posts to a given topic, yet the
generation only increases by 1. The only guarantee is that after a topic post, the current
generation value is larger than any value previously queried.

Tying this all together is the topic_monitor_t. This provides the current topic generations, and
also provides the ability to perform a blocking wait for any topic to change in a particular topic
set. This is the real power of topics: you can wait for a sigchld signal OR a thread exit.

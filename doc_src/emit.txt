\subsection emit-description Description

`emit` emits, or fires, an event. Events are delivered to, or caught by, special functions called event handlers. The arguments are passed to the event handlers as function arguments.


\subsection emit-example Example

The following code first defines an event handler for the generic event named 'test_event', and then emits an event of that type.

\fish
function event_test --on-event test_event
    echo event test: $argv
end

emit test_event something
\endfish

#
# Completions for the gpg program.
#
# This program accepts an rather large number of switches. It allows
# you to do things like changing what file descriptor errors should be
# written to, to make gpg use a different locale than the one
# specified in the environment or to specify an alternative home
# directory.

# Switches related to debugging, switches whose use is not
# recommended, switches whose behaviour is as of yet undefined,
# switches for experimental features, switches to make gpg compliant
# to legacy pgp-versions, dos-specific switches, switches meant for
# the options file and deprecated or obsolete switches have all been
# removed. The remaining list of completions is still quite
# impressive.

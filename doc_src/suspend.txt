\subsection suspend-description Description

`suspend` suspends the current shell. In order to prevent suspending a
shell that isn't a subshell, it will not suspend a shell if it is a
login shell, or of `$SHLVLV` is less `$suspend_minimum_SHLVL`, which
defaults to three. This test is skipped if the `--force` option is
given or the shell is not interactive.

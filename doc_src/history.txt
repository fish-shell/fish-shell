\subsection history-description Description

`history` is used to list, search and delete the history of commands used.

The following commands are available:

- `-s` or `--search` returns history items matching the search string. If no search string is provided it returns all history items. This is the default operation if no other operation is specified. Entries are ordered newest to oldest.

- `-d` or `--delete` deletes history items. Without the `--prefix` or `--contains` options, the exact match will be deleted. With either of these options, a prompt will be displayed before any items are deleted.

- `-m` or `--merge` immediately incorporates history changes from other sessions. Ordinarily `fish` ignores history changes from sessions started after the current one. This command applies those changes immediately.

- `-v` or `--save` saves all changes in the history file. The shell automatically saves the history file; this option is provided for internal use.

- `-l` or `--clear` clears the history file. A prompt is displayed before the history is erased asking you to confirm you really want to clear all history.

The following options are available:

- `--prefix` searches or deletes items in the history that begin with the specified text string.

- `--contains` searches or deletes items in the history that contain the specified text string. This is the default.

- `--with-time` prefixes the output of each displayed history entry with the time it was recorded in the format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" in your local timezone.

\subsection history-examples Example

\fish
history --clear
# Deletes all history items

history --search --contains "foo"
# Outputs a list of all previous commands containing the string "foo".

history --delete --prefix "foo"
# Interactively deletes the record of previous commands which start with "foo".

\subsection history-notes Notes

If you specify both `--prefix` and `--contains` the last flag seen is used.

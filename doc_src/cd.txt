\section cd cd - change directory

\subsection cd-synopsis Synopsis
\fish{synopsis}
cd [DIRECTORY]
\endfish

\subsection cd-description Description
`cd` changes the current working directory.

If `DIRECTORY` is supplied, it will become the new directory. If no parameter is given, the contents of the `HOME` environment variable will be used.

If `DIRECTORY` is a relative path, the paths found in the `CDPATH` environment variable array will be tried as prefixes for the specified path.

Note that the shell will attempt to change directory without requiring `cd` if the name of a directory is provided (starting with `.`, `/` or `~`, or ending with `/`).


\subsection cd-example Examples

\fish
cd
# changes the working directory to your home directory.

cd /usr/src/fish-shell
# changes the working directory to /usr/src/fish-shell
\endfish

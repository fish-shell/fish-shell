\subsection suspend-description Description

`suspend` suspends execution of the current shell by sending it a
SIGTSTP signal, returning to the controlling process. It can be
resumed later by sending it a SIGCONT.  In order to prevent suspending
a shell that doesn't have a controlling process, it will not suspend a
the shell if it is a login shell or if `$SHLVL` is less
`$suspend_minimum_SHLVL`, which defaults to three. This test is
skipped if the `--force` option is given or the shell is not
interactive.

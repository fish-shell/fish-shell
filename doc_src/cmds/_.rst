.. _cmd-_:

_ - call ghoti's translations
============================

Synopsis
--------

.. synopsis::

    _ STRING

Description
-----------

``_`` translates its arguments into the current language, if possible.

It is equivalent to ``gettext ghoti STRING``, meaning it can only be used to look up ghoti's own translations.

It requires ghoti to be built with gettext support. If that support is disabled, or there is no translation it will simply echo the argument back.

The language depends on the current locale, set with :envvar:`LANG` and :envvar:`LC_MESSAGES`.


Options
-------

``_`` takes no options.

Examples

\section command command - run a program

\subsection command-synopsis Synopsis
<tt>command [OPTIONS] COMMANDNAME [ARGS...]</tt>

\subsection command-description Description

\c command forces the shell to execute the program \c COMMANDNAME and ignore any functions or builtins with the same name.

The following options are available:
- \c -h or \c --help prints help and then exits.
- \c -s or \c --search returns the name of the disk file that would be executed, or nothing if no file with the specified name could be found in the <tt>$PATH</tt>.

With the \c -s option, \c command treats every argument as a separate command to look up and sets the exit status to 0 if any of the specified commands were found, or 1 if no commands could be found.

For basic compatibility with POSIX <tt>command</tt>, the \c -v flag is recognized as an alias for <tt>-s</tt>.

\subsection command-example Examples

<tt>command ls</tt> causes fish to execute the \c ls program, even if an 'ls' function exists.

<tt>command -s ls</tt> returns the path to the \c ls program.

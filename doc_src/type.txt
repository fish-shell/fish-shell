\subsection type-description Description

With no options, indicate how each name would be interpreted if used as a command name.

- \c -h or \c --help print this message
- \c -a or \c --all print all of possible definitions of the specified names
- \c -f or \c --no-functions suppresses function and builtin lookup
- \c -t or \c --type print a string which is one of keyword, function, builtin, or file if name is a shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file, respectively
- \c -p or \c --path either return the name of the disk file that would be executed if name were specified as a command name, or nothing if 'type  -t  name' would  not  return 'file'
- \c -P or \c --force-path either return the name of the disk file that would be executed if name were specified as a command name, or nothing no file with the specified name could be found in the PATH

\c type returns a zero exit status if the specified command was found,
otherwise the exit status is one.

\subsection type-example Example

<tt>type fg</tt> outputs the string 'fg is a shell builtin'.

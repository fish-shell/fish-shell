/// Compare two strings, representing file names, using "natural" ordering. This means that letter
/// case is ignored. It also means that integers in each string are compared based on the decimal
/// value rather than the string representation. It only handles base 10 integers and they can
/// appear anywhere in each string, including multiple integers. This means that a file name like
/// "0xAF0123" is treated as the literal "0xAF" followed by the integer 123.
///
/// The intent is to ensure that file names like "file23" and "file5" are sorted so that the latter
/// appears before the former.
///
/// This does not handle esoterica like Unicode combining characters. Nor does it use collating
/// sequences. Which means that an ASCII "A" will be less than an equivalent character with a higher
/// Unicode code point. In part because doing so is really hard without the help of something like
/// the ICU library. But also because file names might be in a different encoding than is used by
/// the current fish process which results in weird situations. This is basically a best effort
/// implementation that will do the right thing 99.99% of the time.

.SH NAME
PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.rs
.sp
.B #include <pcre2.h>
.PP
.nf
.B int pcre2_substring_get_bynumber(pcre2_match_data *\fImatch_data\fP,
.B "  uint32_t \fInumber\fP, PCRE2_UCHAR **\fIbufferptr\fP, PCRE2_SIZE *\fIbufflen\fP);"
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This is a convenience function for extracting a captured substring by number
into newly acquired memory. The arguments are:
.sp
  \fImatch_data\fP    The match data for the match
  \fInumber\fP        Number of the required substring
  \fIbufferptr\fP     Where to put the string pointer
  \fIbufflen\fP       Where to put the string length
.sp
The memory in which the substring is placed is obtained by calling the same
memory allocation function that was used for the match data block. The
convenience function \fBpcre2_substring_free()\fP can be used to free it when
it is no longer needed. The yield of the function is zero for success or one of
the following error numbers:
.sp
  PCRE2_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING   there are no groups of that number
  PCRE2_ERROR_UNAVAILBLE    the ovector was too small for that group
  PCRE2_ERROR_UNSET         the group did not participate in the match
  PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY      memory could not be obtained
.sp

\subsection nextd-description Description

`nextd` moves forwards `POS` positions in the history of visited directories; if the end of the history has been hit, a warning is printed.

If the `-l` or `--list` flag is specified, the current directory history is also displayed.

Note that the `cd` command limits directory history to the 25 most recently visited directories. The history is stored in the `$dirprev` and `$dirnext` variables which this command manipulates.

# Working directory is now /usr/src/fish-shell

Fish for bash users
===================

This is to give you a quick overview if you come from bash (or to a lesser extent other shells like zsh or ksh) and want to know how fish differs. Fish is intentionally not POSIX-compatible and as such some of the things you are used to work differently.

Many things are similar - they both fundamentally expand commandlines to execute commands, have pipes, redirections, variables, globs, use command output in various ways. This document is there to quickly show you the differences.

.. _bash-command-substitutions:

Command substitutions
---------------------

Fish spells command substitutions as ``$(command)`` or ``(command)``, but not ```command```.

In addition, it only splits them on newlines instead of $IFS. If you want to split on something else, use :doc:`string split <cmds/string-split>`, :doc:`string split0 <cmds/string-split>` or :doc:`string collect <cmds/string-collect>`. If those are used as the last command in a command substitution the splits they create are carried over. So::

  for i in (find . -print0 | string split0)

will correctly handle all possible filenames.

Variables
---------

Fish sets and erases variables with :doc:`set <cmds/set>` instead of ``VAR=VAL`` and a variety of separate builtins like ``declare`` and ``unset`` and ``export``. ``set`` takes options to determine the scope and exportedness of a variable::

  # Define $PAGER *g*lobal and e*x*ported,
  # so this is like ``export PAGER=less``
  set -gx PAGER less

  # Define $alocalvariable only locally,
  # like ``local alocalvariable=foo``
  set -l alocalvariable foo

or to erase variables::

  set -e PAGER


``VAR=VAL`` statements are available as environment overrides::

  PAGER=cat git log


Fish does not perform word splitting. Once a variable has been set to a value, that value stays as it is, so double-quoting variable expansions isn't the necessity it is in bash. [#]_

For instance, here's bash

.. code-block:: sh

  > foo="bar baz"
  > printf '"%s"\n' $foo
  # will print two lines, because we didn't double-quote
  # this is word splitting
  "bar"
  "baz"

And here is fish::

  > set foo "bar baz"
  > printf '"%s"\n' $foo
  # foo was set as one element,
  # so it will be passed as one element, so this is one line
  "bar baz"

All variables are "arrays" (we use the term "lists"), and expanding a variable expands to all its elements, with each element as its own argument (like bash's ``"${var[@]}"``::

  > set var "foo bar" banana
  > printf %s\n $var
  foo bar
  banana

Specific elements of a list can be selected::

  echo $list[5..7]

The arguments to ``set`` are ordinary, so you can also set a variable to the output of a command::

  # Set lines to all the lines in file, one element per line
  set lines (cat file)

or a mixture of literal values and output::

  > set numbers 1 2 3 (seq 5 8) 9
  > printf '%s\n' $numbers
  1
  2
  3
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9

A ``=`` is unnecessary and unhelpful with ``set`` - ``set foo = bar`` will set the variable "foo" to two values: "=" and "bar". ``set foo=bar`` will print an error.

See :ref:`Shell variables <variables>` for more.

.. [#] zsh also does not perform word splitting by default (the SH_WORD_SPLIT option controls this)

.. _bash-globs:

Wildcards (globs)
-----------------

Fish only supports the ``*`` and ``**`` glob (and the deprecated ``?`` glob) as syntax. If a glob doesn't match it fails the command (like with bash's ``failglob``) unless the command is ``for``, ``set`` or ``count`` or the glob is used with an environment override (``VAR=* command``), in which case it expands to nothing (like with bash's ``nullglob`` option).

Globbing doesn't happen on expanded variables, so::

  set foo "*"
  echo $foo

will not match any files.

There are no options to control globbing so it always behaves like that.

See :ref:`Wildcards <expand-wildcard>` for more.

Quoting
-------

Fish has two quoting styles: ``""`` and ``''``. Variables are expanded in double-quotes, nothing is expanded in single-quotes.

There is no ``$''``, instead the sequences that would transform are transformed *when unquoted*::

  > echo a\nb
  a
  b

See :ref:`Quotes <quotes>` for more.

String manipulation
-------------------

Fish does not have ``${foo%bar}``, ``${foo#bar}`` and ``${foo/bar/baz}``. Instead string manipulation is done by the :doc:`string <cmds/string>` builtin.

For example, to replace "bar" with "baz"::

  > string replace bar baz "bar luhrmann"
  baz luhrmann

It can also split strings::

  > string split "," "foo,bar"
  foo
  bar

Match regular expressions as a replacement for ``grep``::

  > echo bababa | string match -r 'aba$'
  aba

Pad strings to a given width, with arbitrary characters::

  > string pad -c x -w 20 "foo"
  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxfoo

Make strings lower/uppercase::

  > string lower Foo
  foo

  > string upper Foo
  FOO

repeat strings, trim strings, escape strings or print a string's length or width (in terminal cells).

Special variables
-----------------

Some bash variables and their closest fish equivalent:

- ``$*``, ``$@``, ``$1`` and so on: ``$argv``
- ``$?``: ``$status``
- ``$$``: ``$fish_pid``
- ``$#``: No variable, instead use ``count $argv``
- ``$!``: ``$last_pid``
- ``$0``: ``status filename``
- ``$-``: Mostly ``status is-interactive`` and ``status is-login``

Process substitution
----------------------

Instead of ``<(command)`` fish uses ``(command | psub)``. There is no equivalent to ``>(command)``.

Note that both of these are bashisms, and most things can easily be expressed without. E.g. instead of::

  source (command | psub)

just use::

  command | source

as fish's :doc:`source <cmds/source>` can read from stdin.

Heredocs
--------

Fish does not have ``<<EOF`` "heredocs". Instead of

.. code-block:: sh

  cat <<EOF
  some string
  some more string
  EOF

use::

  printf %s\n "some string" "some more string"

or::

  echo "some string
  some more string"

  # or if you want the quotes on separate lines:

  echo "\
  some string
  some more string\
  "

Quotes are followed across newlines.

What "heredocs" do is:

1. Read/interpret the string, with special rules, up to the terminator. [#]_
2. Write the resulting string to a temporary file.
3. Start the command the heredoc is attached to with that file as stdin.

This means it is essentially the same as just reading from a pipe, so::

  echo "foo" | cat

is mostly the same as

.. code-block:: sh

  cat <<EOF
  foo
  EOF

Just like with heredocs, the command has to be prepared to read from stdin. Sometimes this requires special options to be used, often giving a filename of ``-`` turns it on.

For example::

  echo "xterm
  rxvt-unicode" | pacman --remove -

  # is the same as (the `-` makes pacman read arguments from stdin)
  pacman --remove xterm rxvt-unicode

and could be written in other shells as

.. code-block:: sh

  # This "-" is still necessary - the heredoc is *also* passed over stdin!
  pacman --remove - << EOF
  xterm
  rxvt-unicode
  EOF
  
So heredocs really are just minor syntactical sugar that introduces a lot of special rules, which is why fish doesn't have them. Pipes are a core concept, and are simpler and compose nicer.

.. [#] For example, the "EOF" is just a convention, the terminator can be an arbitrary string, something like "THISISTHEEND" also works. And using ``<<-`` trims leading *tab* characters (but not other whitespace), so you can indent the lines, but only with tabs. Substitutions (variables, commands) are done on the heredoc by default, but not if the terminator is quoted: ``cat << "EOF"``.

Test (``test``, ``[``, ``[[``)
------------------------------

Fish has a POSIX-compatible ``test`` or ``[`` builtin. There is no ``[[`` and ``test`` does not accept ``==`` as a synonym for ``=``. It can compare floating point numbers, however.

``set -q`` can be used to determine if a variable exists or has a certain number of elements (``set -q foo[2]``).

Arithmetic Expansion
--------------------

Fish does not have ``$((i+1))`` arithmetic expansion, computation is handled by :doc:`math <cmds/math>`::

  math $i + 1

Unlike bash's arithmetic, it can handle floating point numbers::

  > math 5 / 2
  2.5

And also has some functions, like for trigonometry::

  > math cos 2 x pi
  1

You can pass arguments to ``math`` separately like above or in quotes. Because fish uses ``()`` parentheses for :ref:`command substitutions <bash-command-substitutions>`, quoting is needed if you want to use them in your expression::

  > math '(5 + 2) * 4'

Both ``*`` and ``x`` are valid ways to spell multiplication, but ``*`` needs to be quoted because it looks like a :ref:`glob <bash-globs>`.

Prompts
-------

Fish does not use the ``$PS1``, ``$PS2`` and so on variables. Instead the prompt is the output of the :doc:`fish_prompt <cmds/fish_prompt>` function, plus the :doc:`fish_mode_prompt <cmds/fish_mode_prompt>` function if vi-mode is enabled and the :doc:`fish_right_prompt <cmds/fish_right_prompt>` function for the right prompt.

As an example, here's a relatively simple bash prompt:

.. code-block:: sh

    # <$HOSTNAME> <$PWD in blue> <Prompt Sign in Yellow> <Rest in default light white>
    PS1='\h\[\e[1;34m\]\w\[\e[m\] \[\e[1;32m\]\$\[\e[m\] '

and a rough fish equivalent::

  function fish_prompt
      set -l prompt_symbol '$'
      fish_is_root_user; and set prompt_symbol '#'

      echo -s (prompt_hostname) \
      (set_color blue) (prompt_pwd) \
      (set_color yellow) $prompt_symbol (set_color normal)
  end

This shows a few differences:

- Fish provides :doc:`set_color <cmds/set_color>` to color text. It can use the 16 named colors and also RGB sequences (so you could also use ``set_color 5555FF``)
- Instead of introducing specific escapes like ``\h`` for the hostname, the prompt is simply a function. To achieve the effect of ``\h``, fish provides helper functions like :doc:`prompt_hostname <cmds/prompt_hostname>`, which prints a shortened version of the hostname.
- Fish offers other helper functions for adding things to the prompt, like :doc:`fish_vcs_prompt <cmds/fish_vcs_prompt>` for adding a display for common version control systems (git, mercurial, svn), and :doc:`prompt_pwd <cmds/prompt_pwd>` for showing a shortened ``$PWD`` (the user's home directory becomes ``~`` and any path component is shortened).

The default prompt is reasonably full-featured and its code can be read via ``type fish_prompt``.

Fish does not have ``$PS2`` for continuation lines, instead it leaves the lines indented to show that the commandline isn't complete yet.

Blocks and loops
----------------

Fish's blocking constructs look a little different. They all start with a word, end in ``end`` and don't have a second starting word::

  for i in 1 2 3; do
     echo $i
  done

  # becomes
  
  for i in 1 2 3
     echo $i
  end

  while true; do
     echo Weeee
  done

  # becomes

  while true
     echo Weeeeeee
  end

  {
     echo Hello
  }

  # becomes
  
  begin
     echo Hello
  end

  if true; then
     echo Yes I am true
  else
     echo "How is true not true?"
  fi

  # becomes

  if true
     echo Yes I am true
  else
     echo "How is true not true?"
  end

  foo() {
     echo foo
  }

  # becomes

  function foo
      echo foo
  end

  # (bash allows the word "function",
  #  but this is an extension)

Fish does not have an ``until``. Use ``while not`` or ``while !``.

Subshells
---------

Bash has a feature called "subshells", where it will start another shell process for certain things. That shell will then be independent and e.g. any changes it makes to variables won't be visible in the main shell.

This includes things like:

.. code-block:: sh

    # A list of commands in `()` parentheses
    (foo; bar) | baz

    # Both sides of a pipe
    foo | while read -r bar; do
        # This will not be visible outside of the loop.
        VAR=VAL
        # This background process will not be, either
        baz &
    done

``()`` subshells are often confused with ``{}`` grouping, which does *not* use a subshell. When you just need to group, you can use ``begin; end`` in fish::

    (foo; bar) | baz
    # when it should really have been:
    { foo; bar; } | baz
    # becomes
    begin; foo; bar; end | baz

The pipe will simply be run in the same process, so ``while read`` loops can set variables outside::

    foo | while read bar
        set -g VAR VAL
        baz &
    end

    echo $VAR # will print VAL
    jobs # will show "baz"

Subshells are also frequently confused with :ref:`command substitutions <bash-command-substitutions>`, which bash writes as ```command``` or ``$(command)`` and fish writes as ``$(command)`` or ``(command)``. Bash also *uses* subshells to implement them.

The isolation can usually be achieved by just scoping variables (with ``set -l``), but if you really do need to run your code in a new shell environment you can always use ``fish -c 'your code here'`` to do so explicitly.

Builtins and other commands
---------------------------

By now it has become apparent that fish puts much more of a focus on its builtins and external commands rather than its syntax. So here are some helpful builtins and their rough equivalent in bash:

- :doc:`string <cmds/string>` - this replaces most of the string transformation (``${i%foo}`` et al) and can also be used instead of ``grep`` and ``sed`` and such.
- :doc:`math <cmds/math>` - this replaces ``$((i + 1))`` arithmetic and can also do floats and some simple functions (sine and friends).
- :doc:`argparse <cmds/argparse>` - this can handle a script's option parsing, for which bash would probably use ``getopt`` (zsh provides ``zparseopts``).
- :doc:`count <cmds/count>` can be used to count things and therefore replaces ``$#`` and can be used instead of ``wc``.
- :doc:`status <cmds/status>` provides information about the shell status, e.g. if it's interactive or what the current linenumber is. This replaces ``$-`` and ``$BASH_LINENO`` and other variables.

- ``seq(1)`` can be used as a replacement for ``{1..10}`` range expansion. If your OS doesn't ship a ``seq`` fish includes a replacement function.

Other facilities
----------------

Bash has ``set -x`` or ``set -o xtrace`` to print all commands that are being executed. In fish, this would be enabled by setting :envvar:`fish_trace`.

Or, if your intention is to *profile* how long each line of a script takes, you can use ``fish --profile`` - see the :doc:`page for the fish command <cmds/fish>`.

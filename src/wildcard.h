    Expand the wildcard by matching against the filesystem.

  New strings are allocated using malloc and should be freed by the caller.

  wildcard_expand works by dividing the wildcard into segments at
  each directory boundary. Each segment is processed separatly. All
  except the last segment are handled by matching the wildcard
  segment against all subdirectories of matching directories, and
  recursively calling wildcard_expand for matches. On the last
  segment, matching is made to any file, and all matches are
  inserted to the list.

  If wildcard_expand encounters any errors (such as insufficient
  priviliges) during matching, no error messages will be printed and
  wildcard_expand will continue the matching process.

  \param wc The wildcard string
  \param working_directory The working directory
  \param flags flags for the search. Can be any combination of EXPAND_FOR_COMPLETIONS and EXECUTABLES_ONLY
  \param out The list in which to put the output

  \return 1 if matches where found, 0 otherwise. Return -1 on abort (I.e. ^C was pressed).

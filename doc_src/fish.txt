\subsection fish-description Description

\c fish is a command-line shell written mainly with interactive use in mind. The
full manual is available <a href='index.html'>in HTML</a> by using the
<a href='#help'>help</a> command from inside fish.

The following options are available:

- <code>-c</code> or `--command=COMMANDS` evaluate the specified commands instead of reading from the commandline
- <code>-d</code> or `--debug-level=DEBUG_LEVEL` specify the verbosity level of fish. A higher number means higher verbosity. The default level is 1.
- <code>-h</code> or `--help` display help and exit
- <code>-i</code> or `--interactive` specify that fish is to run in interactive mode
- <code>-l</code> or `--login` specify that fish is to run as a login shell
- <code>-n</code> or `--no-execute` do not execute any commands, only perform syntax checking
- <code>-p</code> or `--profile=PROFILE_FILE` when fish exits, output timing information on all executed commands to the specified file
- <code>-v</code> or `--version` display version and exit

The fish exit status is generally the exit status of the last
foreground command. If fish is exiting because of a parse error, the
exit status is 127.

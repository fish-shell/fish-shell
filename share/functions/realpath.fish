# Provide a minimalist realpath implementation to help deal with platforms that may not provide it
# as a command. If a realpath command is available simply pass all arguments thru to it. If not
# fallback to alternative solutions.

# The following is slightly subtle. The first time `realpath` is invoked by autoloading this script
# will be read. If we see that there is an external realpath command we just return. That will cause
# fish to run the external command. Or, if there is a grealpath, we alias it.
# On the other hand, if an external command isn't found we provide a function that will facilitate
# fallback behavion through our builtin.

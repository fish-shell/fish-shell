\subsection status-description Description

With no arguments, `status` displays a summary of the current login and job control status of the shell.

The following operations (sub-commands) are available:

- `is-command-sub` returns 0 if fish is currently executing a command substitution. Also `-c` or `--is-command-substitution`.

- `is-block` returns 0 if fish is currently executing a block of code. Also `-b` or `--is-block`.

- `is-interactive` returns 0 if fish is interactive - that is, connected to a keyboard. Also `-i` or `--is-interactive`.

- `is-login` returns 0 if fish is a login shell - that is, if fish should perform login tasks such as setting up the PATH. Also `-l` or `--is-login`.

- `is-full-job-control` returns 0 if full job control is enabled. Also `--is-full-job-control` (no short flag).

- `is-interactive-job-control` returns 0 if interactive job control is enabled. Also, `--is-interactive-job-control` (no short flag).

- `is-no-job-control` returns 0 if no job control is enabled. Also `--is-no-job-control` (no short flag).

- `current-filename` prints the filename of the currently running script. Also `-f` or `--current-filename`.

- `current-line-number` prints the line number of the currently running script. Also `-n` or `--current-line-number`.

- `job-control CONTROL-TYPE` sets the job control type, which can be `none`, `full`, or `interactive`. Also `-j CONTROL-TYPE` or `--job-control=CONTROL-TYPE`.

- `print-stack-trace` prints a stack trace of all function calls on the call stack. Also `-t` or `--print-stack-trace`.

\subsection status-notes Notes

For backwards compatibility each subcommand can also be specified as a long or short option. For example, rather than `status is-login` you can type `status --is-login`. The flag forms are deprecated and may be removed in a future release (but not before fish 3.0).

You can only specify one subcommand per invocation even if you use the flag form of the subcommand.

\subsection random-description Description

`RANDOM` generates a psuedo-random integer from a uniform distribution in
the inclusive range [START; END] with a spacing of STEP. One argument
indicates a START of 0, two arguments indicates a STEP of 1. Only integer
arguments are supported and STEP should be strictly positive.

If a `SEED` value is provided, the random number will be generated from that
seed, meaning that you will get the same generated number throughout multiple
invocations with the same parameters. Providing a seed will NOT give the same
result across different systems.

You should not consider `RANDOM` cryptographically secure.

\subsection random-example Example

The following code will count down from a random even number between 10 and 20 to 1:

\fish
for i in (seq (random 10 20 2) -1 1)
    echo $i
end
\endfish

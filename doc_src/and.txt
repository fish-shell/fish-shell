\subsection and-description Description

`and` is used to execute a command if the current exit status (as set by the last previous command) is 0.

`and` does not change the current exit status.

The exit status of the last foreground command to exit can always be accessed using the <a href="index.html#variables-status">$status</a> variable.


\subsection and-example Example

The following code runs the `make` command to build a program. If the build succeeds, `make`'s exit status is 0, and the program is installed. If either step fails, the exit status is 1, and `make clean` is run, which removes the files created by the build process.

make; and make install; or make clean
\endfish

begin - start a new block of code
=================================

Synopsis
--------

begin; [COMMANDS...;] end


Description
-----------

``begin`` is used to create a new block of code.

A block allows the introduction of a new variable scope, redirection of the input or output of a set of commands as a group, or to specify precedence when using the conditional commands like ``and``.

The block is unconditionally executed. ``begin; ...; end`` is equivalent to ``if true; ...; end``.

``begin`` does not change the current exit status itself. After the block has completed, ``$status`` will be set to the status returned by the most recent command.


Example
-------

The following code sets a number of variables inside of a block scope. Since the variables are set inside the block and have local scope, they will be automatically deleted when the block ends.



::

    begin
        set -l PIRATE Yarrr
    
        ...
    end
    
    echo $PIRATE
    # This will not output anything, since the PIRATE variable
    # went out of scope at the end of the block


In the following code, all output is redirected to the file out.html.



::

    begin
        echo $xml_header
        echo $html_header
        if test -e $file
            ...
        end
        ...
    end > out.html

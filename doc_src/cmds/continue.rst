.. _cmd-continue:

continue - skip the remainder of the current iteration of the current inner loop
================================================================================

Synopsis
--------

::

    LOOP_CONSTRUCT; [COMMANDS...;] continue; [COMMANDS...;] end

Description
-----------

``continue`` skips the remainder of the current iteration of the current inner loop, such as a :ref:`for <cmd-for>` loop or a :ref:`while <cmd-while>` loop. It is usually added inside of a conditional block such as an :ref:`if <cmd-if>` statement or a :ref:`switch <cmd-switch>` statement.

Example
-------

The following code removes all tmp files that do not contain the word smurf.

::

    for i in *.tmp
        if grep smurf $i
            continue
        end
        # This "rm" is skipped over if "continue" is executed.
        rm $i
        # As is this "echo"
        echo $i
    end

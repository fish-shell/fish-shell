# This script sets up a clean environment for a script or executable to execute in/under. It creates
# (and sets) $TMPDIR initialized to a clean & unique temporary directory, creates a new $HOME, sets
# the relevant XDG_* directories to point to subdirectories of that $HOME, cleans up any potentially
# problematic environment variables, executes the provided command, waits for it to exit, then
# cleans up the newly created environment before bubbling up the exit code. $PWD is not changed.
# If sourced instead of executed, sets up the environment as before but does not execute any payload
# and does not destroy the newly created environment.

# macOS has really weird default IFS behavior that splits output in random places, and the trailing
# backspace is to prevent \n from being gobbled up by the subshell output substitution.
# Folks, this is why you should use fish!

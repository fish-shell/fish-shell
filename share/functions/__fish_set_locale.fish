# Try to set the locale from the system configuration if we did not inherit any. One case where this
# can happen is a linux with systemd where the user logs in via getty (e.g., on the system console).
# See https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3092. This isn't actually our job, so there's
# a bunch of edge-cases we are unlikely to handle properly. If we get a value for _any_ language
# variable, we assume we've inherited something sensible so we skip this to allow the user to set it
# at runtime without mucking with config files.
#
# NOTE: This breaks the expectation that an empty LANG will be the same as LANG=POSIX, but an empty
# LANG seems more likely to be caused by a missing or misconfigured locale configuration.

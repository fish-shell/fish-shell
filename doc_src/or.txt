\subsection or-description Description

`or` is used to execute a command if the current exit status (as set by the previous command) is not 0.

`or` statements may be used as part of the condition in an <a href="#if">`and`</a> or <a href="#while">`while`</a> block. See the documentation
for <a href="#if">`if`</a> and <a href="#while">`while`</a> for examples.

`or` does not change the current exit status. The exit status of the last foreground command to exit can always be accessed using the <a href="index.html#variables-status">$status</a> variable.

\subsection or-example Example

The following code runs the `make` command to build a program. If the build succeeds, the program is installed. If either step fails, `make clean` is run, which removes the files created by the build process.

\fish
make; and make install; or make clean
\endfish

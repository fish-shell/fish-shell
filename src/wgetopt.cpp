/** \file wgetopt.c
  A version of the getopt library for use with wide character strings.

  This is simply the gnu getopt library, but converted for use with
  wchar_t instead of char. This is not usually useful since the argv
  array is always defined to be of type char**, but in fish, all
  internal commands use wide characters and hence this library is
  useful.

  If you want to use this version of getopt in your program,
  download the fish sourcecode, available at <a
  href='http://fishshell.com'>the fish homepage</a>. Extract
  the sourcode, copy wgetopt.c and wgetopt.h into your program
  directory, include wgetopt.h in your program, and use all the
  regular getopt functions, prefixing every function, global
  variable and structure with a 'w', and use only wide character
  strings. There are no other functional changes in this version of
  getopt besides using wide character strings.

  For examples of how to use wgetopt, see the fish builtin
  functions, many of which are defined in builtin.c.

/* This version of `getopt' appears to the caller like standard Unix `getopt'

   As `getopt' works, it permutes the elements of ARGV so that,
   when it is done, all the options precede everything else.  Thus
   all application programs are extended to handle flexible argument order.

   GNU application programs can use a third alternative mode in which
   they can distinguish the relative order of options and other arguments.  */

/* Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
   given in OPTSTRING.

   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
   from each of the option elements.

   If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
   updating `woptind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.

   If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns `EOF'.
   Then `woptind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
   so that those that are not options now come last.)

   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `wopterr' to
   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.

   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
   ARGV-element, is returned in `optarg'.  Two colons mean an option that
   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
   it is returned in `w.woptarg', otherwise `w.woptarg' is set to zero.

   If OPTSTRING starts with `-' or `+', it requests different methods of
   handling the non-option ARGV-elements.
   See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.

   Long-named options begin with `--' instead of `-'.
   Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique
   or is an exact match for some defined option.  If they have an
   argument, it follows the option name in the same ARGV-element, separated
   from the option name by a `=', or else the in next ARGV-element.
   When `getopt' finds a long-named option, it returns 0 if that option's
   `flag' field is nonzero, the value of the option's `val' field
   if the `flag' field is zero.

   LONGOPTS is a vector of `struct option' terminated by an
   element containing a name which is zero.

   LONGIND returns the index in LONGOPT of the long-named option found.
   It is only valid when a long-named option has been found by the most
   recent call.

   If LONG_ONLY is nonzero, '-' as well as '--' can introduce
   long-named options.  */

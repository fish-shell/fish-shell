    # This is the default value (as of the time I wrote this) but I'm making
    # it explicit since it needs to agree with the value used by clang-format.
    # Thus, if we ever change the fish style to allow longer or shorter lines
    # this should be changed (as well as the corresponding .clang-format file).
    #
    - key: LONG_LINE
      value: 100
    #
    # The default limit for the length of variable names is 20. Long names are
    # problematic but twenty chars results in way too many errors. So increase
    # the limit to something more reasonable.
    #
    - key: LONG_VARIABLE_NAME
      value: 30

disable-rules:
    #
    # A few instances of "useless parentheses" errors are meaningful. Mostly
    # in the context of the `return` statement. Unfortunately the vast
    # majority would result in removing parentheses that decreases
    # readability. So we're going to ignore this warning and rely on humans to
    # notice when the parentheses are truly not needed.
    #
    # Also, some macro expansions, such as FD_SET(), trigger this warning and
    # we don't want to suppress each of those individually.
    #
    - UselessParentheses
    #
    # OCLint wants variable names to be at least three characters in length.
    # Which would be fine if it supported a reasonable set of exceptions
    # (e.g., "i", "j", "k") and allowed adding additional exceptions to match
    # conventions employed by a project. Since it doesn't, and thus generates
    # a lot of really annoying warnings, we're going to disable this rule.
    #
    - ShortVariableName
    #
    # This rule flags perfectly reasonable conditions like `if (!some_condition)`
    # and is therefore just noise. Disable this rule.

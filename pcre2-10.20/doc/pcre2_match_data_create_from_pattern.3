.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This function creates a new match data block, which is used for holding the
result of a match. The first argument points to a compiled pattern. The number
of capturing parentheses within the pattern is used to compute the number of
pairs of offsets that are required in the match data block. These form the
"output vector" (ovector) within the match data block, and are used to identify
the matched string and any captured substrings.
.P
The second argument points to a general context, for custom memory management,
or is NULL to use the same memory allocator as was used for the compiled
pattern. The result of the function is NULL if the memory for the block could
not be obtained.

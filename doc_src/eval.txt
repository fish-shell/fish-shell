\subsection eval-description Description
<tt>eval</tt> evaluates the specified parameters as a command. If more than one parameter is specified, all parameters will be joined using a space character as a separator.

\subsection eval-example Example

The following code will call the ls command. Note that \c fish does not
support the use of environment variables as direct commands; \c eval can
be used to work around this.

<pre>
set cmd ls
eval $cmd
</pre>

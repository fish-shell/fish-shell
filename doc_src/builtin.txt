The following parameters are available:

- `-n` or `--names` List the names of all defined builtins
- `-q` or `--query` tests if any of the specified builtins exists.


\subsection builtin-example Example

\fish
builtin jobs
# executes the jobs builtin, even if a function named jobs exists
\endfish
